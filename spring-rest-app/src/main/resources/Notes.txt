2) This can be done without using spring-data and any other third party library.
3) Cache name is the parent key which holds all the cache(by default map).
4) @Cacheable use the passed argument as key value by default. If no arg, then auto generated "SimpleKey []" 
	will be used as the key which will be autogenerated.
5) If a complete object is used as argument then be sure to override hashcode and equals method to avoid 
	duplicate keys.
